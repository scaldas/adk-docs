# TypeScript Quickstart for ADK

This guide shows you how to get up and running with Agent Development Kit
for TypeScript. Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js 24.13.0 or later
*   Node Package Manager (npm) 11.8.0 or later

## Create an agent project

Create an empty `my-agent` directory for your project:

```none
my-agent/
```

??? tip "Create this project structure using the command line"

    === "MacOS / Linux"

        ```bash
        mkdir -p my-agent/
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```console
        mkdir my-agent
        ```

### Configure project and dependencies

Use the `npm` tool to install and configure dependencies for your project,
including the package file, ADK TypeScript main
library, and developer tools. Run the following commands from your
`my-agent/` directory to create the `package.json` file and install the
project dependencies:

```console
cd my-agent/
# initialize a project as an ES module
npm init --yes
npm pkg set type="module"
npm pkg set main="agent.ts"
# install ADK libraries
npm install @google/adk
# install dev tools as a dev dependency
npm install -D @google/adk-devtools
```

### Define the agent code

Create the code for a basic agent, including a simple implementation of an ADK
[Function Tool](/adk-docs/tools/function-tools/), called `getCurrentTime`.
Create an `agent.ts` file in your project directory and add the following code:

```typescript title="my-agent/agent.ts"
import {FunctionTool, LlmAgent} from '@google/adk';
import {z} from 'zod';

/* Mock tool implementation */
const getCurrentTime = new FunctionTool({
  name: 'get_current_time',
  description: 'Returns the current time in a specified city.',
  parameters: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The name of the city for which to retrieve the current time."),
  }),
  execute: ({city}) => {
    return {status: 'success', report: `The current time in ${city} is 10:30 AM`};
  },
});

export const rootAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: 'hello_time_agent',
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  description: 'Tells the current time in a specified city.',
  instruction: `You are a helpful assistant that tells the current time in a city.
                Use the 'getCurrentTime' tool for this purpose.`,
  tools: [getCurrentTime],
});
```

### Set your API key

This project uses the Gemini API, which requires an API key. If you
don't already have Gemini API key, create a key in Google AI Studio on the
[API Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) page.

In a terminal window, write your API key into your `.env` file of your project
to set environment variables:

```bash title="Update: my-agent/.env"
echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
```

??? tip "Using other AI models with ADK"
    ADK supports the use of many generative AI models. For more
    information on configuring other models in ADK agents, see
    [Models & Authentication](/adk-docs/agents/models).

## Run your agent

You can run your ADK agent with the `@google/adk-devtools` library as an
interactive command-line interface using the `run` command or the ADK web user
interface using the `web` command. Both these options allow you to test and
interact with your agent.

### Run with command-line interface

Run your agent with the ADK TypeScript command-line interface tool
using the following command:

```console
npx adk run agent.ts
```

### Run with web interface

Run your agent with the ADK web interface using the following command:

```console
npx adk web
```

This command starts a web server with a chat interface for your agent. You can
access the web interface at (http://localhost:8000). Select your agent at the
upper right corner and type a request.

!!! warning "Caution: ADK Web for development only"

    ADK Web is ***not meant for use in production deployments***. You should
    use ADK Web for development and debugging purposes only.

## Next: Build your agent

Now that you have ADK installed and your first agent running, try building
your own agent with our build guides:
