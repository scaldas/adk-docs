Turn your ADK agents into full-featured applications with rich, responsive UIs.
[AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com/) is an open protocol that handles streaming
events, client state, and bi-directional communication between your agents and
users.

[AG-UI](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui) provides a consistent interface
to empower rich clients across technology stacks, from mobile to the web and
even the command line. There are a number of different clients that support
AG-UI:

- [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai) provides tooling and components to tightly
  integrate your agent with web applications
- Clients for
  [Kotlin](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/kotlin),
  [Java](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/java),
  [Go](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/sdks/community/go/example/client),
  and [CLI
  implementations](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/apps/client-cli-example/src)
  in TypeScript

This tutorial uses CopilotKit to create a sample app backed by an ADK agent that
demonstrates some of the features supported by AG-UI.

## Quickstart

To get started, let's create a sample application with an ADK agent and a simple
web client:

1. Create the app:

    ```bash
    npx copilotkit@latest create -f adk
    ```

2. Set your Google API key:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```

3. Install dependencies and run:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```

This starts two servers:

- **http://localhost:3000** - The web UI (open this in your browser)
- **http://localhost:8000** - The ADK agent API (backend only)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to chat with
your agent.

## Features

### Chat

Chat is a familiar interface for exposing your agent, and AG-UI handles
streaming messages between your users and agents:

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
<CopilotSidebar
  clickOutsideToClose={false}
  defaultOpen={true}
  labels={{
    title: "Popup Assistant",
    initial: "👋 Hi, there! You're chatting with an agent. This agent comes with a few tools to get you started..."
  }}
/>
```

Learn more about the chat UI
[in the CopilotKit docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/adk/agentic-chat-ui).

### Generative UI

AG-UI lets you share tool information with a Generative UI so that it can be
displayed to users:

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
useRenderToolCall(
  {
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get the weather for a given location.",
    parameters: [{ name: "location", type: "string", required: true }],
    render: ({ args }) => {
      return <WeatherCard location={args.location} themeColor={themeColor} />;
    },
  },
  [themeColor],
);
```

Learn more about Generative UI
[in the CopilotKit docs](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/adk/generative-ui).

### Shared State

ADK agents can be stateful, and synchronizing that state between your agents and
your UIs enables powerful and fluid user experiences. State can be synchronized
both ways so agents are automatically aware of changes made by your user or
other parts of your application:

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
const { state, setState } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
  name: "my_agent",
  initialState: {
    proverbs: [
      "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.",
    ],
  },
})
```
