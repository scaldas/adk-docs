# Windsor.ai MCP tool for ADK

<div class="language-support-tag">
  <span class="lst-supported">Supported in ADK</span><span class="lst-python">Python</span><span class="lst-typescript">TypeScript</span>
</div>

The [Windsor MCP Server](https://github.com/windsor-ai/windsor_mcp) connects
your ADK agent to [Windsor.ai](https://windsor.ai/), a data integration
platform that unifies marketing, sales, and customer data from 325+ sources.
This integration gives your agent the ability to query and analyze cross-channel
business data using natural language, without writing SQL or custom scripts.

## Use cases

- **Marketing Performance Analysis**: Analyze campaign performance across
  channels like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, and more. Ask questions
  like "What campaigns had the best ROAS last month?" and get instant insights.

- **Cross-Channel Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports combining data
  from multiple platforms such as GA4, Shopify, Salesforce, and HubSpot to get
  a unified view of business performance.

- **Budget Optimization**: Identify underperforming campaigns, detect budget
  inefficiencies, and get AI-driven recommendations for spend allocation across
  advertising channels.

## Prerequisites

- A [Windsor.ai](https://windsor.ai/) account with connected data sources
- A Windsor.ai API key (obtain from [onboard.windsor.ai](https://onboard.windsor.ai))
