# Restate plugin for ADK

<div class="language-support-tag">
  <span class="lst-supported">Supported in ADK</span><span class="lst-python">Python</span>
</div>

[Restate](https://restate.dev) is a durable execution engine that turns ADK
agents into innately resilient, robust systems. It provides persistent sessions,
pause/resume for human approvals, resilient multi-agent orchestration, safe
versioning, and full observability and control over every execution. All LLM
calls and tool executions are journaled, so if anything fails, your agent
recovers from exactly where it left off.

## Use cases

The Restate plugin gives your agents:

- **Durable execution**: Never lose progress. If your agent crashes, it picks up
  exactly where it left off, with automatic retries and recovery.
- **Pause/resume for human-in-the-loop**: Pause execution for days or weeks
  until a human approves, then resume where you left off.
- **Durable state**: Agent memory and conversation history persist across
  restarts with built-in session management.
- **Observability & Task control**: See exactly what your agent did and kill,
  pause, and resume agent executions at any time.
- **Resilient multi-agent orchestration**: Run resilient workflows across
  multiple agents with parallel execution.
- **Safe versioning**: Deploy new versions without breaking ongoing executions
  via immutable deployments.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys)

To run the example below, you'll also need:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (or
  [Brew/npm/binary](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally)
  for the Restate server)

## Installation

Install the Restate SDK for Python:

```bash
pip install "restate-sdk[serde]"
```

## Use with agent

Follow these steps to run a durable agent and inspect its execution journal in
the Restate UI:

1. **Clone the [restate-google-adk-example repository](https://github.com/restatedev/restate-google-adk-example) and navigate to the example**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/restatedev/restate-google-adk-example.git
    cd restate-google-adk-example/examples/hello-world
    ```

2. **Export your Gemini API key**

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

3. **Start the weather agent**

    ```bash
    uv run .
    ```

4. **Start Restate in another terminal**

    ```bash
    docker run --name restate --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9070:9070 -d \
      --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
      docker.restate.dev/restatedev/restate:latest
    ```

    Other installation methods: [Brew, npm, binary
    downloads](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/local_dev#running-restate-server--cli-locally)

5. **Register the agent**

    Open the Restate UI at `localhost:9070` and register your agent deployment
    (e.g., `http://host.docker.internal:9080`):

    ![Restate registration](./assets/restate-registration.png)

    !!! tip "Safe versioning"

        Restate registers each deployment as an immutable snapshot. When you
        deploy a new version, ongoing executions finish on the original
        deployment while new requests route to the latest one. Learn more about
        [version-aware routing](https://docs.restate.dev/services/versioning).

6. **Send a request to the agent**

    In the Restate UI, select **WeatherAgent**, open the **Playground**, and
    send a request:

    ![Send request in the UI](./assets/restate-request.png)

    !!! tip "Durable sessions and retries"

        This request goes through Restate, which persists it before forwarding
        to your agent. Each session (here `session-1`) is isolated, stateful,
        and durable. If the agent crashes mid-execution, Restate automatically
        retries and resumes from the last journaled step, without losing
        progress.

7. **Inspect the execution journal**

    Click on the **Invocations** tab and then on your invocation to see the
    execution journal:

    ![Restate journal in the UI](./assets/restate-journal.png)

    !!! tip "Full control over agent executions"

        Every LLM call and tool execution is recorded in the journal. From the
        UI, you can pause, resume, restart from any intermediate step, or kill
        an execution. Check the **State** tab to inspect your agent's current
        session data.

## Capabilities

The Restate plugin provides the following capabilities for your ADK agents:

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Durable tool execution | Wraps tool logic with `restate_object_context().run_typed()` so it retries and recovers automatically |
| Human-in-the-loop | Pauses execution with `restate_object_context().awakeable()` until an external signal (e.g. human approval) |
| Persistent sessions | `RestateSessionService()` stores agent memory and conversation state durably |
| Durable LLM calls | `RestatePlugin()` journals LLM calls with automatic retries |
| Multi-agent communication | Durable cross-agent HTTP calls with `restate_object_context().service_call()` |
| Parallel execution | Run tools and agents concurrently with `restate.gather()` for deterministic recovery |
